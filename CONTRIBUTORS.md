# Contributors

Before this project was released, numerous contributors both inside and outside of Google
worked on building, testing, and teaching the curriculum. Since a typical stream of commits
can't be referenced, we'd like to recognize those who helped build the program.

Alphabetically by surname:

* [Naomi Alterman](https://github.com/naclomi): co-instructor of the beta run of the 
  program, author of many of the early slide decks and the initial version of the ethical
  storyboard.
* [Juliana de Heer](https://github.com/juemura): teacher's assistant of the beta run of the
  program, author of many of the early slide decks and special topics labs.

*If you were a contributor and would like to be included in this list, please submit a pull request.*
